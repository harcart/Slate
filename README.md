# Slate
## What is it? 
Slate was a project developed through 'Hello World 2019', Purdue University's freshman hackathon. 
The purpose of Slate was to enable a new level of mobile collaboration. Through this real-time 
whiteboard users can share notes, play games, create art and more.

## Organization/Project Management
To increase efficiency the team was split up into two/three groups, meeting every 4-5 hours. This allowed us
to maintain communication while still having time to develop the primary technologies. The group was split into
the following teams:

- UI Team: Developed the application's frontend and allowed for drawing on the whiteboard locally
- Cloud Team: Designed and implemented the teams backend, allowing for cloud syncing technology
- Integration Team: Worked between the two teams ensuring the product was going to meet it's end goal
